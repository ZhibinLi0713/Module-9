Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
IS operator used to checks whether an object is compatible with a given type.


Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
They allow user to define a class or method that can work with any data type, and it can improve the performance and type safety.


Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
Scopes in a class are available to any non-static method within the class.


Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
Yes.

Q: What is an enumeration?
In C#, enum is a data type to contain a set of named integers.


Q: What is inheritance?

Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
|array|arraylist|
|strong typed|any typed|
|sized|unsized|
|Use static to perform different tasks|includes various utility methods for various tasks|


Q: Define constructor.
Constructors have the same name as the class or struct, and they usually initialize the data members of the new object.


Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
var can only be used when a local variable is declared and initialized in the same statement.


Q: What is an abstract class?
Abstract classes create classes and class members that are incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class, and they are typically used to define a base class in the hierarchy.


Q: What is an interface?
An interface is defined as a syntactical contract that all the classes inheriting the interface should follow, and it defines properties, methods, and events.


Q: What is a method?
It is a code block which contain some statements. Simalar to function in C.


Q: What is a property?
Property is something defined in classes, structures, and interfaces, and it differs classes.


Q: What is an access specifier?

Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
Q: What is a collection?
Collection classes are specialized classes for data storage and retrieval. 


Q: What is a Hash Table?
The Hashtable class represents a collection of key-and-value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key.
